  <br/>

I am a Full Stack Developer with 8+ years of experience in developing enterprise applications and open-source software.

### My Opensource Story
All of my projects are released as open-source on GitHub, this includes some of my GitHub trending projects:
- [Nothing Private](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/nothing-private) - This project is a proof of concept that any website can identify and track you, even if you are using private browsing or incognito mode in your web browser. It has around 1000K+ users and 1.8K+ stars.  It got discussed in many privacy forums and conferences worldwide. Various privacy-focused browser vendors were able to implement fixes to prevent fingerprinting due to this project. It also made lots of people aware of the bad effects of browser fingerprinting.
- [Blog Post Workflow](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/blog-post-workflow) - A Github action to show your latest blog posts from any sources or StackOverflow activity or Youtube Videos on your GitHub profile/project readme automatically using the RSS feed. It is now used by over 5.6K+ users and running on thousands of GitHub actions runner every hour. It is also one of the top 20 [most used](https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=sort%3Apopularity-desc&type=actions&verification=) GitHub actions internationally in GitHub Marketplace.
-  [SoCLI](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/socli) scored 300+ stars within 24 hours of its release. It now has almost 2K+ users. It provides an easy way of accessing StackOverflow even if you are hooked into a terminal.
- [Motrix WebExtension](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/motrix-webextension) - A browser extension for the Motrix Download Manager. It now has more than 10K+ users worldwide.
- [Refined GitHub Feeds](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/refined-github-feeds) - A browser extension that adds filtering to the Github news feeds. 
Most of my leisure time is to contribute to open-source projects on GitHub. Acknowledging my extensive contribution to DuckDuckGo's open source projects, I was promoted as a maintainer and community leader with write access to all DuckDuckGo's repositories. I had contributed to Mozilla, Angular, Svelte, Node.JS, and several other open-source projects and organizations.

I also maintain and contribute to a lot of community open-source projects and libraries. Some of the communities includes [Tinkerhub Foundation](https://tinkerhub.org/), [Kites Foundation](https://kitesfoundation.org/), [Mozilla Foundation](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/), [Patternfly](https://www.patternfly.org/) etc. I strongly believe that the true value of open-source is not just the code, it's the community around it.

You can learn more about me and my open source journey at my website: [https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/](https://www.gautamkrishnar.com/)

Most of the open-source projects I create are the solutions to the problems I face in my life, there are even more that are yet unsolved. I am on a journey to find solutions for them, one at a time.
